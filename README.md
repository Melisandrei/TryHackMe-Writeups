# TryHackMe-Writeups
CTF Writeups and Learning Repository
Welcome to my cybersecurity journey repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my writeups and analyses of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, modules, and rooms completed on TryHackMe (I will probably create a new repository for similar websites in the future such as HackTheBox). Here, you'll find detailed explanations of my approach and solutions to these exercises, designed to deepen my understanding of various cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

This repository serves as a personal learning tool and a showcase of my progress and dedication to the field of cybersecurity. It is my hope that it can also provide insight to industry professionals and future employers regarding the practical skills and knowledge I have acquired through hands-on experience.


My current plan is to complete the free roadmap on TryHackMe and then subscribe to the paid subscription version. After completing both of these I will be completing the practice rooms and CTF whilst also looking into the TryHackMe networks.
