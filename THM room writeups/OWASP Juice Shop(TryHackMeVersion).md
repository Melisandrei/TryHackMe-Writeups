Link to Room: [Here](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/owaspjuiceshop)

Within this room, we will look at OWASP's TOP 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. You will find these in all types of web applications. But for today we will be looking at OWASP's own creation, Juice Shop!

Juice Shop is a large application so the full top 10 will not be covered - I will cover this in a more complete writeup of just the Juice shop lab.

The following topics are covered as you progress through this room.
