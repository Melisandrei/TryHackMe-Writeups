# **Cybersecurity Glossary**

**Active Directory** - A Microsoft-developed database and service that manages users, devices, and network resources within an organization. \
**DC** - Domain controller - A server that manages security authentication requests in a Windows Server network. It stores user account information and controls access to resources on the network. It is a critical component for managing and securing a network infrastructure. \
**EDR** - Endpoint detecion & response - A series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat. \
**ELK** - ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kabana - Three open-source tools that are commonly used together to collect, store, analyse, and visualise data. \
**FTP** - File transfer protocol - A protocol designed to help the efficient transfer of files between different and even non-compatible systems. It supports two modes for file transfer: binary and ASCII (text). \
**GoBuster** - A free and open-source directory and file enumeration tool. Penetration testers and security professionals use it to find hidden directories and files on web servers. \
**HTTP** - Hypertext transfer protocol - The protocol that specifies how a web browser and a web server communicate. Your web browser requests content from the web server using the HTTP protocol. \
**IoT** - Internet of things - Refers to the network of physical objects, or "things", that are embedded with sensors and software which allow them to collect and exchange data over the Internet. These objects can include various devices, from everyday household items like thermostats, refrigerators, and lightbulbs, to industrial equipment, vehicles, and more. \
**IM** - Incident management - Covers the process aspect of dealing with an incident. This is the portion that is responsible for answering the primary question: *How do we respond to what happened?* \
**IR** - Incident response - Covers the technical aspect of dealing with an incident. This is the portion that is responsible for answering the primary question: *What happened?* \
**Keberos** - A computer network authentication protocol that operates based on tickets, allowing nodes to securely prove their identity to one another over a non-secure network. It primarily aims at a client-server model and provides mutual authentication, where the user and the server verify each other's identity. The Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks, and it builds on symmetric-key cryptography, requiring a trusted third party. \
**PID** - Process ID - Stands for Process ID. It is a unique identifier assigned to each running process in a system. PIDs are usually assigned in sequential order as processes are created, but can be recycled once a process has completed and terminated. \
**NTLM** - Windows New Technology LAN Manager - A suite of security protocols offered by Microsoft to authenticate users’ identity and protect the integrity and confidentiality of their activity. \
**SIEM** - Security information and endpoint management - A series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat. \
**SOC** - Security operations centre - A team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems. \
**Splunk** - A platform for collecting, storing, and analysing machine data. It provides various tools for analysing data, including search, correlation, and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organisations of all sizes can use to improve their IT operations and security posture. \
**SSH** - Secure shell - A cryptographic network protocol used in secure communication between devices. SSH encrypts data using cryptographic algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption System (AES) and is often used when logging in remotely to a computer or server. \
**Sysmon** - System monitor -  A Windows system service and device driver developed by Microsoft that is designed to monitor and log various events happening within a Windows system. \
**TGT** - Ticket granting ticket - In Kerberos, a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) serves as a user's proof of authentication and allows a user to request service tickets from the KDC, which can then be used to connect to services across the network. \
**TTL** - Time to live - The amount of time or “hops” that a packet is set to exist inside a network before being discarded by a router. TTL is also used in other contexts including CDN caching and DNS caching. \
**VPN** - Virtual private network - A way to create a secure "tunnel" between two networks. For example, you use a VPN on a site to access the private network on which the machines operate. VPNs are also commonly used for an employee to log into their workplace when they are not on site (such as working from home or travelling for business matters). VPNs are also used where networks (such as coffee shops) do not provide encryption, and are a great way of preventing others from reading your network traffic.
