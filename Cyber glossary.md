# **Cybersecurity Glossary**


**EDR** - Endpoint detecion & response - A series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat. \
**ELK** - ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kabana - Three open-source tools that are commonly used together to collect, store, analyse, and visualise data. \
**FTP** - File transfer protocol - A protocol designed to help the efficient transfer of files between different and even non-compatible systems. It supports two modes for file transfer: binary and ASCII (text). \
**IM** - Incident management - Covers the process aspect of dealing with an incident. This is the portion that is responsible for answering the primary question: *How do we respond to what happened?* \
**HTTP** - Hypertext transfer protocol - The protocol that specifies how a web browser and a web server communicate. Your web browser requests content from the web server using the HTTP protocol. \
**IR** - Incident response - Covers the technical aspect of dealing with an incident. This is the portion that is responsible for answering the primary question: *What happened?* \
**SIEM** - Security information and endpoint management - A series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat. \
**SOC** - Security operations centre - A team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a companyâ€™s network and systems. \
**Splunk** - A platform for collecting, storing, and analysing machine data. It provides various tools for analysing data, including search, correlation, and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organisations of all sizes can use to improve their IT operations and security posture. \
**SSH** - Secure shell - A cryptographic network protocol used in secure communication between devices. SSH encrypts data using cryptographic algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption System (AES) and is often used when logging in remotely to a computer or server. \
**Sysmon** - System monitor -  A Windows system service and device driver developed by Microsoft that is designed to monitor and log various events happening within a Windows system. \
**VPN** - Virtual private network - A way to create a secure "tunnel" between two networks. For example, you use a VPN on a site to access the private network on which the machines operate. VPNs are also commonly used for an employee to log into their workplace when they are not on site (such as working from home or travelling for business matters). VPNs are also used where networks (such as coffee shops) do not provide encryption, and are a great way of preventing others from reading your network traffic.
